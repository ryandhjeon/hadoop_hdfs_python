# #3 Hadoop, HDFS, & Python

__1. How much time did you spend on each part of the assignment?__

Gitlab & Git: About 1 minute

Docker setup/usage: Few hours. The setup was done in reflection #2, but the issue was on not being able to connect datanode from local. Solved through discussion in Discord. 

Actual reflection work: About 2~3 hours. Continuous editing.   

__2. What was the hardest part of this assignment?__

The hardest part, and stressful part was setting up the Docker.
Since the reflection #2 worked without any issue, I just concluded that the setup is done correctly without any issue.
The error message appeared constantly until I noticed the issue was on the connection.

__3. What was the easiest part of this assignment?__

After finishing off some Python projects from last semester, working with Python was rather fun. 

__4. What did I actually learn from doing this assignment?__

The Command Line and Python API are completely different. There were not many APIs that acted same way as Command Line. However, at the end, I am able to achieve my goal in both ways.   

__5. Why does what I learned matter both academically and practically?__

As I mentioned in reflection #2, there will be a situation in real world projects that require me to do a Hadoop task in Command Line or Python.
It is important to have skill and experience in both so that I do not panic in any situation. Learning how to do it correctly in academic setting is important.
